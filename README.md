 I made  a python program to give pretty much all the data you can ask for for RLC resonant circuits (Series / Parallel). It also saves the values so that you don't to renter the every time.

Here are some features:
Zero Voltage Switching
Uses only one IGBT
Easy Tuning


For Python program:
Download and Install Python Program.
Run the commands below in command prompt.

py -m pip install numpy
py -m pip install pandas
py -m pip install matplotlib

Double click on script to run it.
